    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Mission Statement</h2>
        <p style=" text-align:center; padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">
            This is an in depth version of the mission statement from the home page. The purpose of my site is to allow for an easy and overall smooth experience for any clients that would like to get a tattoo. I want to make my website a helpful experience where my clients are able to see my art, and also learn about me as well so that I can establish a connection and make the in person appointment a more welcoming experience where I am viewed as a friend rather than just another artist.</p>
        </p> 
        <h2 style="Text-align: Center;">How I got Into Tattooing</h2>
        <p style=" text-align:center; padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">
             I got my first tattoo when I was 16 and got it covered my Senior year, because I didn't want it anymore. After that I started drawing custom tattoos that I liked. Shortly after I purchased a tattoo kit off Amazon and went straight to work on my leg. I kept coming to school with new tattoos and eventually my friends wanted me to practice on them. I started tatooing my senior year of high school, not even knowing how big of an industry I was playing in. I reconnected with the artist who did my first tatoo, Adam , he was almost mind blown that I picked up a tattoo gun. He helped me steady my hand and showed me how to use the gun right and how deep to go. By a couple months later my work improved so much off what he taught me that he was reccomending me to his clients. Since then Adam has passed away and I continue to tattoo in memory of him as he would never want me to give up because of how far I came on my own.

    <h2 style="Text-align: Center;">Get to know the Artist</h2>
    <p style=" text-align:center; padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;"> 
        My name is Adrianna, I often go by Audi. I am 19 years old and currently a student at ETSU majoring in computing and a self-taught tattoo artist. I'm from Bay City, Michigan, I moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee, where I now live, right after my freshman year of high school. I went to Hixson High School, where I learned I had a passion for art.

    <h2 style="Text-align: Center;">What Influenced My Style </h2>
    <p style=" text-align:center; padding-right: 50px; padding-left: 50px;">
       I do not have a specific style that I currently use, as I am still finding my way in the tattoo world and still learning a lot of realizm. I tend to work with a lot of new school tattoos as they are very popular, but I enjoy working with all styles. I like to use procreate to put my tattoo designs together, it gives me more freedom to put pieces together, change the style of things, and be able to put multiple tattoos togehter into one design.
